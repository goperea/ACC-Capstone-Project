ACC-Capstone-Project
====================
Since I started working on the capstone project I've been:

    Learning HTML, Bootstrap , CSS ,  JavaScript & Ajax.
    
    Deciding which project to develop and what container, DB and IDE to use.
        - Will work on the sample project.
        - using Tomcat.
        - Derby DB
        - using NetBeans.
        
    Create the website Home Page with the follwing options already working.
        - Navigation bar.
        - Display the 5 most recent reviewd movies.
        - Display all available movies in the DB.
        - About page with project information.
    
    Create the Deployment Descriptor(DD) web.xml file containing:
        - Derby DB connection driver, user & password as context parameters.
        - Mapping for the servlet class controler.
        - the path for the listener class.
        
    Create and populate DB file to store the movies to be reviwed that contains:
        - Movie Id.
        - Movie Title.
        - Movie Image URL.
        - Movie LastReviewDate.
    
    Create and populate db file to store reviews that conatins:
        - Review movie Id
        - Review date
        - Review comment.
    
    Create the db file to store users that contains.
        - User name
        - User password
    
    Write the first version of the DB access listener class.
    
    Write the class that generates the movie bean with the last 5 reviewed movies.
    
    Write the Controller Class that so far list all the movies on the DB.
    
    Write and implement Sign in and Register servlets to be able to make reviews.
    
    SO FAR THIS IS WHAT I'VE DONE JUST BY MYSELF WITHOUT ANY HELP.
    FOLLOWING I WILL LIST ALL THE OPTIONS THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FINISH THE PROJECT.
    
        1.- SQL script for creating the schema or a java class that creates the schema and data.
        
        2.- Create a java object for accessing movie revie data.
        
        3.- Update the home page to use Movie Review Mgr to display the name and image of a randomly
            selected movie.
        
        4.- Create a details page for each review showing the full details.
        
        5.- Update movie review mgr to have a method find MmovieById.
        
        6.- Create a page for creating a new review.
